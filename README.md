## 🚀 About Me
<div align="center">
Hi there 👋

My name is Maciej and I'm a Symfony developer with 6 years of commercial experience in this exact field.
<br>
Besides that I code 👨‍💻 a bit of <i>mostly useless</i> stuff just to kill time and automate <i>this and that</i>.
<br>
But... why?
</div>

For fun!

I had my first Atari at 13 YO, my first PC at 16 and internet acces at 20.

I spent a lot of time on reverse-engineering the code I found inside OS or random CDs before I even could have some documentation or even coding tools. 

Well, time goes by, toys are more complicated but I still have fun.

Code is not always useful, but always entertaining.

Sadly, never finished.
